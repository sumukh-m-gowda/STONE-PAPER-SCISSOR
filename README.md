# 🪨 Stone Paper Scissor

This is a simple **Stone Paper Scissor** game I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s the classic childhood game — but this time, it runs right in your browser  

I made this project while learning about **DOM manipulation**, **event listeners**, and **localStorage** in JavaScript.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- You pick **Stone**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** using buttons  
- The computer randomly picks one too  
- JavaScript compares both choices and shows who wins  
- The result and score get updated instantly on the page  
- Your total score is saved in **localStorage**, so it doesn’t reset every time
